This project addresses the few-shot challenge in predicting the punching shear capacity of single-plate composite slabs by establishing a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework.  
The execution environment requires torch==2.8.0, xgboost==3.1.2, shap==0.48.0, scikit-learn==1.7.1, pandas==2.2.3, numpy==2.2.3, matplotlib==3.10.6, joblib==1.5.2, openpyxl==3.2.0b1. 
By placing datasets in the ../data directory and running the main script, the system automatically generates comprehensive reports in ../results.

Due to GitHub's storage restrictions, the large-scale finite element validation files are hosted externally.
